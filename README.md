### What is JoeSchmoe ðŸ˜…?

Joe Schmoes are colorful characters illustrated by Jon&Jess that can be used as profile picture placeholders for live websites or design mock ups.
Check them [Here](https://joeschmoe.io/).

The big advantage of the API is that when you request the same Schmoe multiple times, you'll get the same avatar each timeâ€”perfect for when you're associating an image with a user's identity.
